/* Write a grading program for a class with the following grading policies: 
 a. There are two quizzes, each graded based on 10 points. 
 b. There are one midterm exam and one 
final exam, each graded based on 100 points. 
c. The final exam counts for 50 percent of the grade, the 
midterm counts for 25 percent, and the two quizzes together count for a total of 25 percent. (Do not 
forget to normalize the quiz scores. They should be converted to a percent before they are averaged in.) 
Any grade of 90 or more is an A, any grade of 80 or more (but less than 90) is a B, any grade of 70 or 
more (but less than 80) is a C, any grade of 60 or more (but less than 70) is a D, and any grade below 60 
is an F. 
The program will read in the student’s scores and output the student’s record, which consists of two 
quizzes and two exam scores as well as the student’s average numeric score for the entire course and 
the final letter grade. Define and use a structure for the student record. If this is a class assignment, ask 
your instructor if input/output should be done with the keyboard and screen or if it should be done with 
files. If it is to be done with files, ask your instructor for instructions on file names.*/
