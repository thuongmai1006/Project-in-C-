/*Create a base (parent) class called Vehicle that has the manufacturerâ€™s name (type 
string), number of cylinders in the engine (type int), and owner (type Person, see the 
class given below). Then create a class called Truck that is derived (inherited) from 
Vehicle and has additional properties: the load capacity in tons (type double) and 
towing capacity in pounds (type int). Be sure your classes have constructors, assessor, 
and mutator member functions. Write a driver program (a main function) that tests all 
of your member functions. */
